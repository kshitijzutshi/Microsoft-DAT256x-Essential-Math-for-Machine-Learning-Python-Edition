## All the math you might need for machine learning [list of resources] (feel free to add and comment via PR)

1. https://mml-book.github.io/ Well, this is literally almost all the math necessary for machine learning. Covering everything in great detail requires more than ~400 pages, but overall this is the most detailed guide on the mathematics used in machine learning. The book is freely available [here](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf).

2. http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf These concise guides belong to the famous CS229 course by Andrew Ng and are very helpful for refreshing one's knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory. Don't expect it to be comprehensive. Expectedly, the primary purpose of the notes is to serve as a brief refresher that you can use to find out which subjects you should revisit.

3. https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/prob.html Very close in quality and coverage to the notes above. By the way, both the notes from Stanford and DL Book also include additional notes on optimization, information theory, and some other subjects. Those, however, are decently covered in mml-book.

4. https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf These notes spend less time on each subject, which doesn't make them bad though. I would recommend using this guide as a checklist of math prerequisites.

5. https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/teaching/18-Maths/paper.pdf Math for intelligent systems. The preface promises that this course will recap the essentials of linear algebra, optimization, probabilities, and statistics, which definitely sounds ambitious. Unlike other resources from the list, I have only briefly skimmed through the notes.

6. https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html Matrix calculus you might need for machine learning.

7. https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf A collection of facts and properties related to matrices.

8. http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls.pdf This is a great book on applied linear algebra in the context of machine learning. Not much time is spent on theoretical aspects, which is probably good considering the applied orientation of the book.

9. http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf Luckily free book on convex optimization.

10. https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/ I wish I was taught statistics using an approach like this.

11. https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/linear-algebra https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/calculus https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/unconstrained-optimization A set of truly visual courses that help you not only understand the subject but also see what's going on under the mathematical hood.

12. https://probabilitycourse.com/ A free and high-quality book to learn probability and statistics. I believe the author has reached some sort of balance between rigor and intuition.
